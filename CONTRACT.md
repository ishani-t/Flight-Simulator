## Team Contract (rhuang25-itaraf2-tu11-nealt2)


### Communication
1. Team Meetings: Our team will meet every Wednesday and Saturday from 7-8 PM in the apartment. 
Each member will rotate being the designated note-taker, starting with rhuang25 (Rachel)! Notes will be stored on Google Docs and kept in a Google Drive folder. The note-taker is also responsible for drafting the weekly DEVELOPMENT LOG entry in google docs, which we will look over at the next meeting. When the development log entry is approved, the note-taker for that week will commit it to github.


2. Assistance: Each team member can be contacted through text message or discord - or just knock on their door and ask. 

4. Respect: The note-taker for the week will also serve as the ‘project lead’ for the weekly meeting. Their role is to ensure that every member of the group has had a chance to state their opinion about a design decision or any other topic related to the final project. All decisions will be accepted by simple majority. By signing this document, each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them.

### Collaboration
1. Work Distribution: Each week, the necessary delivarables for the week will be determined and listed by the full team.
Each member will volunteer to work on one or more deliverables. Each deliverable will also have a 'back-up' team member whom the main developer can refer to with questions.

2. Time Commitment: To ensure an equal distribution of work, each member is expected to independently work between two and five hours per week on the project.
If a deliverable ends up taking more time, the rest of the team should be informed of the unforseen complication, and the rest of the team can meet to work on that issue together.
It is the team’s responsibility, not the individual’s responsibility, to make sure a weekly deliverable is finished by the end of the week.
However if a team member is habitually not completing their tasks, they may be asked – politely – to explain their circumstances. Based on their explanation further actions, such as alerting a staff member, may be taken on a case by case basis decided by the other team
members.

3. Conflict Resolution All conflicts within the team will be settled in a team meeting. Those not involved in the conflict will serve as mediators. Those in conflice will have the chance to speak - if votes are even, we will bring in a neutral third party (our roommate - Peter, who is in mock trial) to settle.
